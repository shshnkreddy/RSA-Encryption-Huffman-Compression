The code of RSA Encryption and Huffman Encoding are both in the Code folder:


HUFFMAN ENCODING:
To run Huffman Compression on any file type the command 
python Compress.py "FILE NAME"
You will get a compressed file of the same name with the extension .bcn
To decrypt that file use the command
python Decompress.py "FILE NAME.bcn"


RSA ENCRYPTION:
To encrypt any file type the command:
python Encrypt.py "FILE NAME"
You will get an encrypted file with the name Encrypted.txt
To decrypt this file run the command:
python Decrypt.py "Encrypted.txt"
You will get a file by the name output.txt which is equivalent to the original file.
